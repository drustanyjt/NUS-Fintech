## Training Wing Project 1

This was a fun and interesting project that unfortunately came in the middle of another competition I had. I would say there is nothing novel or creative about either of these implementations. In fact I believe there are systematic errors arising from bad implementation that a more seasoned user would notice easily. Any similarity to reality is probably just a coincidence. Still, I have learnt a lot about the concepts behing time series analysis, and about the code that makes it work.

I would recommend not delving too deeply on these notebooks, if something seems illogical it is likely an oversight.

During the holidays, I will come back again and work on these. I think there's a lot more to learn about model selection that I rush through this time.
